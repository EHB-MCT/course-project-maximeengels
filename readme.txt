I styled my site using a screen size of 1500 x 864.
Feel free to mute the background audio by rightclicking your browser tab and muting the site.

SETUP:

1. Open your source code editor and use the terminal to "npm install" all dependencies.

2. Connect to "SSL VPN EhB". (School's VPN)

3. Once node_modules is installed, you can rightclick the "node" folder and open it in a terminal.

4. Type "node server.js" to start a local server and make a connection with MongoDB.

5. If you followed these steps correctly and changed your viewport size to 1500 x 864 you can launch the site in your browser.
