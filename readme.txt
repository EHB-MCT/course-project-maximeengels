I styled my site using a screen size of 1500 x 864 so in order to see it how I meant it to be seen, please change your viewport size.
Feel free to mute the background audio by rightclicking your browser tab and muting the site.

SETUP:

1. Open your source code editor and use the terminal to "npm install" all dependencies.

2. Connect to "SSL VPN EhB". (School's VPN)

3. Once node_modules is installed, you can rightclick the "node" folder and open it in a terminal.

4. Type "node server.js" to start a local server and make a connection with MongoDB.

5. If you followed these steps correctly and changed your viewport size to 1500 x 864 you can launch the site in your browser.


USE:

The site's design is self-explanatory but some things are still work in progress like the image rating.
(you can give an image a new title and rating respectively, however I do intend the rating to be stars instead of a number. I will try to implement this during the holidays)
